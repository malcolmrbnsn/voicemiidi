# Voicemiidi

a project to replace my existing usage of voicemeeter's macro buttons application. I found that it tends to have issues with a midi device being disconnected after it has previously connected, and it takes far too long to setup a new layout (i'm using a launchpad with 9*9 programmable buttons.)

## Ideal layout

**components**

- MIDI event listener, responder
- Web based frontend (live preview, config, mobile control?)
- voicemeeter api (could be painful)
